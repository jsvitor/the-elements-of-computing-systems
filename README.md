  "So, an architect, a computer architect is always faced with a trade off of that we want to put more money into the memory and make it larger and faster. Or, does we want to get a cheaper memory, and maybe put the money more in the processing unit? A usual tradeoff is to have a large, cheap memory, maybe slow also, and a very small, expensive, fast memory." Noam explanation.
